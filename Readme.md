## Overview
Quantum algorithms hold significant potential for solving optimization problems. Among them, variational algorithms are particularly promising for near-term quantum devices due to their hybrid quantum-classical approach to parameter optimization. However, challenges like convergence stagnation, such as barren plateaus, often hinder their performance.

This repository introduces a quantum circuit framework with variable topology to address these challenges. The framework incorporates two approaches:

1. An **ansatz-free evolutionary** method known from literature [1].
2. A novel **pseudo-counterdiabatic evolutionary** term, inspired by counterdiabatic physics [2], tailored to the Hamiltonian structure.

Both approaches were applied to the Set Partitioning Problem in this study, as detailed in [Quantum circuit evolutionary framework applid on the set partitioning problem (12/2024)]()

### Instances_Benchmark:
We evaluated our algorithms using 35 benchmark instances from Svensson et al., tailored to the Set Partitioning Problem.

### Functions:
1. ```_utility.py:``` Contains utility functions for reading benchmark files, building Hamiltonians, and solving instances using Gurobi.
2. ```qce.py:``` Implements the Quantum Circuit Evolutionary (QCE) algorithm. To choose between AF-QCE and APCD-QCE, refer to the ```experiment_qce.ipynb``` notebook.

### Notebooks:
1. ```experiment_vqe.ipynb:``` Demonstrates the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) based on the configuration used by Cacao et al. in [3].
2. ```experiment_qce.ipynb:``` Explores the AF-QCE and APCD-QCE methods in both noiseless and noisy scenarios.
